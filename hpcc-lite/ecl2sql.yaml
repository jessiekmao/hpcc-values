  ## The following 'corsAllowed' section is used to configure CORS support
  ##   origin - the origin to support CORS requests from
  ##   headers - the headers to allow for the given origin via CORS
  ##   methods - the HTTP methods to allow for the given origin via CORS
  ##
  #corsAllowed:
  ## origin starting with https will only allow https CORS
  #- origin: https://*.my.com
  #  headers:
  #  - "X-X"
  #  methods:
  #  - "GET"
  #  - "OPTIONS"
  ## origin starting with http will allow http or https CORS
  #- origin: http://www.example.com

# Add remote clients to generated client certificates and make the ESP require that one of the generated certificates is provided by a client in order to connect

  service:
    ## port can be used to change the local port used by the pod. If omitted, the default port (8880) is used
    port: 8888
    ## servicePort controls the port that this service will be exposed on, either internally to the cluster, or externally
    servicePort: 8010
    ## wsdlAddress should be set to the host and port which clients can use to hit this service.
    #   This address is added to the service wsdl files which simplify setting up a SOAP client to hit this service.  There may be many external factors determining the address
    #   that is accible to clients.
    # wsdlAddress: clientfacingaddress:8010
    ## Specify visibility: local (or global) if you want the service available from outside the cluster. Typically, eclwatch and wsecl are published externally, while eclservices is designed for internal use.
    visibility: local
    ## Annotations can be specified on a service - for example to specify provider-specific information such as service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet
    #annotations:
    #  service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet: "mysubnet"
    #  The service.annotations prefixed with hpcc.eclwatch.io should not be declared here. They can be declared
    #  in other services in order to be exposed in the ECLWatch interface. Similar function can be used by other 
    #  applications. For other applications, the "eclwatch" inside the service.annotations should be replaced by
    #  their application names. 
    #  hpcc.eclwatch.io/enabled: "true"
    #  hpcc.eclwatch.io/description: "some description"
    ## You can also specify labels on a service
    #labels:
    #  mylabel: "3"
    ## Links specify the web links for a service. The web links may be shown on ECLWatch.
    #links:
    #- name: linkname
