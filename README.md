# hpcc-values

The goal of hpcc-values was to provide solutions for situations in which the default values.yaml may be inconvenient to use due to it having a lot of content. As of now, there are two solutions: overrides and hpcc-lite.

## Overrides
Overrides uses files to override the default values.yaml which makes it useful for small scenarios because it requires less work.

## Hpcc-lite
Hpcc-lite uses a custom values.yaml file which is useful as it allows you to create whatever configurations you want. It does requrie more work, however, because you need to create the files from scratch.
